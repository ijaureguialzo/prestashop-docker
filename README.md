/ In the broad and final sense all        \
| institutions are educational in the     |
| sense that they operate to form the     |
| attitudes, dispositions, abilities and  |
| disabilities that constitute a concrete |
| personality...Whether this educative    |
| process is carried on in a              |
| predominantly democratic or non-        |
| democratic way becomes, therefore, a    |
| question of transcendent importance not |
| only for education itself but for its   |
| final effect upon all the interests and |
| activites of a society that is          |
| committed to the democratic way of      |
| life. - John Dewey (1859-1953),         |
